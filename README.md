# My Personal Portfolio

This website provide people with more details about me and who I am and the academic and work experience I possess.There are social media links if you would like to know me even more. 
## Design Process

The design process is as follows: the front page would be a few pages scrolling down about the introduction about myself and the academic achievements i possess next would be the about page where I will explain more about myself,following that is the achievement page where I will put my top 3 best acheievemnts.the last page would be the contact me page where my email and phone number is there and a form for the user to fill up if they got any querries to ask.

## Features

Design it so that it is compatable for mobile where there is a side bar hide and show feature.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
